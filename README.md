# arpilisp
A Lisp interpreter written in ARM assembly for the Raspberry Pi. This tutorial uses assembly, the lowest level language, to implement an interpreter for Lisp, the highest level language.  Arpilisp implements Lisp from scratch, with no help from any libraries and minimal help from the kernel.
