# arpilisp

Do you known how to implement a Lisp interpreter? Neither did I until I tried it. This is the result.

Arpilisp is a Lisp interpreter for the Raspberry Pi. This tutorial uses assembly, the lowest level language, to implement an interpreter for Lisp, the highest level language.  Arpilisp implements Lisp from scratch, with no help from any libraries and minimal help from the kernel.

Enjoy.
